## Component Communication in Angular

This repository demonstrates various techniques for sharing data between Angular components. It includes practical examples and code snippets for:

### Input and Output Properties
Using `@Input()` to pass data from parent to child components.

Using `@Output()` with EventEmitter to send data from child to parent components.

### ViewChild
Using `@ViewChild` to access child component properties and methods.

### Service with Observables
Creating a shared service to manage data and state using `RxJS` Observables.

Implementing a service to provide data to multiple components.

### Signals (New)
Using Angular signals to broadcast and listen for events across the application.

Leveraging signals for decoupled and scalable event handling.

### EventEmitter
Utilizing `EventEmitter` for custom event communication between components.
